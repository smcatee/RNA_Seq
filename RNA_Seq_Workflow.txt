General Overview:
Tissue excision → RNA extraction → Enrich by polyA selection → Samples for library construction, transcriptomics, qPCR → cDNA synthesis →  Fragmentation → Size selection → Barcode samples → Send to UCDavis (Illumina) → De novo transcript reconstruction → Raw read quantification → Normalize counts (maybe) → Differential gene expression and/or differential transcript usage → Pretty Graphs!! (data visualization)


Detailed Workflow:

~Tissue excision
?? mg of tissue from (gill?)
Ideally all tissue is excised at similar times with similar techniques to reduce batch effects
Timetable of when tissue is excised:
How many time intervals?  How many from each group for each time?
Tissues of the same treatment group can be combined before RNA extraction step

~Tissue lysis
ThermoFisher lists this method as the highest yielding method they recommend
7.1ug poly(A+)RNA from 0.1g frozen mouse liver tissue
“Submerging the samples in liquid nitrogen will freeze the tissue pieces most quickly” … “The frozen sample is powdered by grinding the frozen tissue fragments in a prechilled mortar and occasionally adding liquid N2 into the mortar to prevent thawing. Once the tissue is ground to a fine powder, the denaturing solution is added to the mortar, and the semi-frozen mixture is stirred. This mixture can then be thawed and transferred to an appropriate vessel for further processing.”

~RNA extraction
Trizol 3:1 phase separation followed by isopropanol and ethanol wash (maybe RNA clean)  
QA/QC: Nanodrop, Bioanalyzer

~Spike-in added to samples

~DNAse

~Enrich by polyA selection
Oligotex mRNA kits (idk what you’ve used in the past)
From https://youtu.be/08h3-05Y9JY
    rRNA reduction
        Probe for species specific rRNA attached to beads
        Allows for non-polyA RNA to be sequenced
    PolyA selection
        oligoDT attached to beads, wash everything else away
        Biases to 3’ end if there is any degradation
    Design oligo primers for known transcriptome, attach to beads
        Can be purchased, there are many for model organisms
    
QA/QC: Bioanalyzer

~cDNA synthesis (can be done before/after fragmentation)
1st strand: random hexamer primers, reverse transcriptase
2nd strand: RNase H, DNA Polymerase I
QA/QC: Bioanalyzer (UC Davis, $12/sample) , Qubit 2.0 Flurometer, qRT-PCR

~Fragmentation (can be done before/after cDNA)
    Restriction enzymes
    QA/QC: Bioanalyzer

~Size selection
    PAGE, SPRI magnetic beads (https://youtu.be/08h3-05Y9JY)

~RNA-Seq Poly-A Library Prep
(UC Davis, $149/sample) (Do we build a library for each sample or for the whole?)

~Barcode samples (aka Indexing)
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3508525/)
https://www.youtube.com/user/Arturgreensward
Barcode region is on the end of adaptors used for PCR amplification
    Make sure 5’ end of A adaptor has phosphate at end of barcode
Avoid palindromes (just use odd bp length barcodes), Hamming distance of 2+ bases
Link to barcode generator is in the third video (produces barcode + adaptor sequence)

~Send to UCDavis (Illumina) & receive raw reads
QA/QC: FastQC, FASTX-Toolkit, Trimmomatic

~AWS Community AMI (https://youtu.be/B69fkgEkCaE)
    Amazon cloud ‘computer’ that is already setup for bioinformatics work
    Allows for much faster computing, so we can compare many workflows quickly
    There are many AMI (Amazon machine image) setup and publically available to copy

~Trim and QC
Trimmomatic
	discard low quality reads/segments/bases: FASTX-Toolkit and/or Trimmomatic
	consider trimming minimally and using minimum read length

~De novo transcript reconstruction
Aligners
    Trinity
    Bowtie/TopHat
        Low memory use, high time
STAR
    Low time use, high memory
HISAT2
    Uses indexing to cut down memory and time
    Splice aware (req ref genome, always??)
QA/QC: Picard, RSeQC, Qualimap
Types of QC for alignment
    3’ and 5’ bias (looks at coverage from beginning to end of reads)
        The coverage should be mostly equal across 
    Nucleotide Content
        Random hexamer primers in cDNA step aren’t totally random
        The hexamer patterns are overexpressed in the beginning of reads
            (should explain with a drawing)
Normal nucleotide content is ~25% for each A, T, G, C
Only effects the first 10 or so bases (why not only the first 6??)
Easy to adjust, simply trim first 10 bases if the nucleotide content is out of whack
        
    Base/Read Quality
        Looks at Phred score along the reads. Tends to drop at the end of reads
        Per Bioinformatics DotCa, Phred > 30 is acceptable
    Sequencing Depth QC
        Resampling (taking a fraction of your data and re-analyzing only that fraction)
        Take increasingly larger fractions of the total reads (randomly chosen reads)
        For each random subset run a specific analysis (e.g. number of splice junctions)
        As subsets become larger the analysis output will level out (saturate)
        Use a type of analysis that directly relates to your experiment
            (What analysis for differential expression??)
    Base Distribution
        Coding, non-coding, etc...

~Raw read quantification (multiple should be tried and compared, per Bioinformatics DotCa)
Sailfish (raw read input. Does not map reads, instead it uses only direct k-mer counting)
Aggregate raw counts → infer transcripts (used sometimes)
HTSeq-count or featureCounts are popular raw count aggregators
They create a Gene Transfer File format (GTF)
Cufflinks
RSEM
    Built to work well with de novo transcripts
doesnt need reference genome, but does need previous de novo transcript assembly
QA/QC: NOISeq, EDASeq

~Normalize counts (maybe)
RPKM - reads per kilobase of exon model per million reads
within-sample normalization
FPKM - fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads
       same as RPKM for SE reads
TPM - transcripts per million
TMM - some sort of normalization tech
       normalization methods that ignore highly variable/expressed features
       TMM, DESeq, PoissonSeq, UpperQuartile

~Batch effect correction (maybe)
COMBAT, ARSyN

~Differential gene expression and/or differential transcript usage (all can be run and compared)
Cuffdiff (takes Cufflinks output)
edgeR takes raw read counts
performs integrated normalization and diff expression analysis
DESeq2 uses negative binomial similar to edgeR 
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.105235)
baySeq, EBSeq
(Bayesian approaches that describe differences among groups and compute posterior probs)
NOISeq, SAMseq make minimal assumptions about the data
estimate null distribution for inferential analysis

Some of the quantifiers above also produce count and probability plots
CummeRbund (Bioconductor)
    Popular RNA data vis package

~Data publication
Should produce Integrated Genome Viewer compatible files

BioProject registration is required as part of data deposit to several NCBI primary data archives including SRA, TSA and WGS.

SRA (Sequence Read Archive, takes our raw info from Illumina for reproducibility)
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/

    


Sequence reads data from other experiments
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=%22Mytilus%20californianus%22%5Borgn%5D&cmd=DetailsSearch

Definitions:

Amplification:
    Copying something (RNA, DNA, cDNA, etc..) many times (exponentially)
Usually used so that there is a higher concentration for the machines to detect
    Things can be selectively amplified so that they stand out more

Coverage (aka Depth):
    The amount of times a sequence is read during sequencing
    Whole RNA → fragmented RNA → converted to cDNA → amplified (copied many times)

Multiplex:
    To combine all samples for sequencing (using barcodes for each sample)

2100 Bioanalyzer by Aligent:
    automated electrophoresis tool for the sample quality control of biomolecules
    Used between RNA extraction/purification steps to assess quality through experiment

NanoDrop Microvolume Spectrophotom//////eter:
    Biomolecule quantification with 1-2ul of sample

Qubit Fluorometer:
    Biomolecule quantification with 1ul dilute sample

Spike-in
    A known RNA sequence of a known concentration that is added to all samples early in the experiment to indirectly test the quality of sampled RNA in each step

Phread Score: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score
    During sequencing the machines give a read-quality-score to each base in the sequence
    Phread quality score = -10 * log10(probability of wrong base)
    Probability of wrong base = 10^(-Phred/10)
    E.g.    Phred = 30 has 1/1000 chance of the base being wrong (accuracy = 99.9%)
        Phred = 50 has 1/100,000 chance of the base being wrong (accuracy = 99.999%)

Duplicates, i.e. PCR Duplication
    A problem during amplification where certain fragments are duplicated early on and become amplified more than others (since amplification is exponential copying)
    To find it plot occurrence of reads vs number of reads (log 10)
        Should be low
    It is more difficult to correct for this with RNA
        We expect many duplicate fragments to be created for RNA
        So need to be more clever to find what is a technical error vs biological variance

FastQC:
    “A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data.” in Java.  Takes raw reads from Illumina as BAM, SAM, or FastQ files.  Produces summary of data quality with graphs

NGSQC:
    QC toolkit for Illumina reads. In Perl. Requires Windows or Linux.

FASTX-Toolkit:
    To process FASTQ files before mapping (incl trim, split samples, rename, masker…)

Trimmomatic:
    “gentle quality trimming and adapter clipping” for Illumina reads

Picard:
ala Jean-Luc Picard (Star Trek)
    Developed and used by Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory
Command line tools (Java) to take BAM files and produce many many metrics
There are a lot

RSeQC:
    “RNA-seq specific modules evaluate sequencing saturation, mapped reads distribution, coverage uniformity, strand specificity, transcript level RNA integrity etc.”

Qualimap:
    facilitate the quality control of alignment sequencing data and its derivatives like feature counts

NOISeq (Bioconductor):
